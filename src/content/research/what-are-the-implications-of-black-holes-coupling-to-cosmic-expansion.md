**Caption**: _This is Figure 4 <a href="https://doi.org/10.21105/astro.2306.08199">in the paper</a>, showing the expected number of detectable binary black hole mergers on earth (per mass bin, log spaced) given all three LVK detectors are working in quadrature for a full year at the third observing run (O3) sensitivity._

In a [recent work](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acb704) that drew substantial attention, observational evidence was found for black hole masses that grow in proportion to the volume of the Universe. Based on this, the authors suggested the existence of a tight coupling between black hole masses and cosmic expansion. In particular, it was proposed that black holes are the source of dark energy (the latter fueling the cosmic expansion). This hypothesis is based on [an earlier work](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab32da/meta) suggesting that all small-scale inhomogeneity should contribute to the pressure term in the Friedmann equations.

This cosmological coupling has other observational implications for the population of black holes and, therefore, could be probed using the available data. As such, [in this study](https://doi.org/10.21105/astro.2306.08199), we consider three observational implications of such cosmologically coupled black holes.

1. We show that due to the suggested cosmological coupling, the gravitational wave emission in binary black hole systems would be significantly enhanced so that the number of black hole mergers would exceed the observed rate by orders of magnitude. Moreover, the typical masses of such black holes would be much larger than those seen by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network.

2. Separately, if the mass growth happens at fixed angular momentum, the supermassive black holes in matter-deficient elliptical galaxies should be slowly rotating. We compare this prediction with the few known spin observations and find the result to be in substantial disagreement.

3. Finally, cosmological coupling would stabilize small black holes against Hawking radiation-induced evaporation. This leads to a tiny window for primordial black hole formation. In particular, the ones that form very early on would today have masses over $10^{11}$ $M_\odot$, while much later black hole production, e.g., during nucleosynthesis, is likely to be disruptive to nucleosynthesis itself.
