**Caption**: _This is Figure 2 [in the paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac120), showing the chirp mass distributions of cumulative events observed by LVK in O3 (black line) and those predicted by various schemes utilized in the paper. The green ticks show the observed values of chirp mass, and the solid grey area represents the uncertainty between the upper and lower chirp mass bounds for these observed events._

There is considerable uncertainty in the exact nature of the supernova explosion mechanism of massive stars. Consequently, one cannot predict with certainty the compact remnant masses resulting from such explosions. Additionally, an asymmetric explosion would also impart a momentum kick to the newly created compact remnant. If the exploding star is part of a binary system, a strong momentum kick might unbind the system. As compact binaries are considered the primary sources for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors, the prescription for calculating the resulting compact remnant mass and their associated kick becomes crucial.

In [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac120), we first predict the expected chirp mass and mass-ratio distributions for gravitational wave transients, taking account of the LVK detector sensitivity in the third observing run (O3). We then investigate how these predictions change by alternating between different remnant mass estimation schemes and supernovae kick prescriptions. We find that none of the model populations resulting from these variations accurately match the whole O3 gravitational-wave transient catalog (e.g., see the Figure). However, agreement from some models to part of the catalog suggests ways to achieve a more complete fit.
