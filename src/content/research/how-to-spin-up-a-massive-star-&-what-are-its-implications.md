**Caption**: _This is Figure 5 [in the paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac3177), showing the minimum threshold accretion required by an accretor to experience homogenous evolution. The legend represents the metalicity of the star. Also, $r_g$ is the radius of gyration of the secondary (with initial mass M$_{\rm ZAMS}$) at the onset of accretion. For demonstration, we have chosen fixed values of $ùëü_g$ = 0.05, 0.1. A lower value of $ùëü_g$ implies that the star is more compact and vice versa. Variable $\nu$ parameterizes the efficiency of accretion of angular momentum from the Keplerian disk.\_

Massive stars are known to be rotating with a range of angular velocities. Although the source of this angular momentum could arise from their progenitor gas cloud, observational evidence from active star-forming regions suggests that this angular momentum might not be retained for a prolonged period of time. Consequently, binary interactions - via tides and/or mass transfer - have become the primary contender for the source of this angular momentum in evolved stars.
But the problem still remains: \_how can one quantitatively predict the influence of binarity on the angular momentum content of a star?

To this end, in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac3177)

1.  We calculate the amount of mass accretion required by a star to spin up to a desired angular velocity (see Appendix 1 of the paper for more information).

2.  The next crucial issue is how to retain this acquired angular momentum. We show that there exists a threshold amount of accretion past which the star could experience so-called chemically homogeneous evolution (see Figure for more information). The latter is important because homogeneous stars are known to experience relatively less spindown over time.

3.  Consequently, we show that accretion-induced homogeneous evolution could be an important formation channel for energetic electromagnetic transients like GRBs, Ic-BL (SLSN-I, Ic-BL) under the collapsar (magnetar) formalism and a single homogeneous star could lead to both the transients under their respective formation scenario.

4.  We also calculate the emission rate of ionizing photons from a stellar population that incoroprates the above appraoch. We find that the emission rate of ionizing photons decreases more rapidly at higher metallicities than previously predicted.
