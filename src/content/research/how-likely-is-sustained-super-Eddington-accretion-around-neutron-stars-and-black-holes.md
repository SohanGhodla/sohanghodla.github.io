**Caption**: _This is Figure 2 [in the paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad1558), showing a schematic diagram of the accretion disk with the various processes and parameters considered. Of particular interest are the “trapped photons” which, instead of leaking out from the disk, are advected into the black hole._

In principle, any further increase in the accretion rate of matter on a central compact object should be halted if the radiation pressure arising from the accretion becomes larger than the inwards pressure on the infalling matter generated due to gravity. However, there could be circumstances where the radiation, though produced, might not be able to deliver this outwards pressure. This can happen if the disk is very dense and the photons scatter so frequently that they cannot leak out before the matter itself gets accreted. Photons that are trapped in this way are called trapped photons.

However, recently, [it was shown](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac7b81/meta) that the formation of a photon-trapping surface, though necessary, might still not be sufficient to ensure unimpeded super-Eddington accretion. In light of this finding, [in this paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad1558), we show that irrespective of the above finding, sustained and unimpeded super-Eddington accretion could still be readily achieved in slim accretion disks surrounding neutron stars and black holes.
